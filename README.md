I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Jilin University in 2023. Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. at the National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), focusing on AI for Science with specialized interests in machine learning-driven materials computation and generative models. My research aims to bridge artificial intelligence and scientific discovery, particularly in accelerating materials innovation through advanced computational approaches.
